## Data visualisation

**Covid19 in Indonesia**

I am using the data from [KawalCovid](https://kawalcovid19.id/) and others to give me a quick overview of the latest worldwide and Indonesian data. The full blog posts [here](https://riyan-aditya.github.io/MyBlog/data%20viz/2020/10/12/CovidID.html) contain interactive data vizualisation that I update weekly. 

Sample visualisation (from December 2020):
