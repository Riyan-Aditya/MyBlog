<p>I have been trying to learn SQL and BI. I used to think that those are unnecessary since I can do everything via Python. But I was wrong.</p>

<h1 id="sql">SQL</h1>
<p>SQL is relatively easy to learn me. Quick enough I realise, to get better I need to practise. I watched several youtube tutorial to get the basic. After that just practise, practise and practise.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&amp;t=5602s">This youtube tutorial</a> gave a good basic foundation for SQL</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/">This web</a> provides a lot of practise question</li>
  <li><a href="https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-order-by/">Second web</a> that provides SQL explanation and also provided examples of SQL problem typically encountered on the job</li>
  <li>Free account from <a href="https://www.stratascratch.com/">this web</a> provides interview style exercies for SQL</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="bi">BI</h1>

<p>Meanwhile, the pwoer of BI software can easily help to visualise data without knowing programming.</p>
