I have been trying to learn SQL and BI. I used to think that those are unnecessary since I can do everything via Python. But I was wrong. 

# SQL
SQL is relatively easy to learn me. Quick enough I realise, to get better I need to practise. I watched several youtube tutorial to get the basic. After that just practise, practise and practise. 
* [This youtube tutorial]<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXV3zeQKqGY&t=5602s> gave a good basic foundation for SQL
* [This web]<https://www.w3resource.com/sql-exercises/> provides a lot of practise question
* [Second web]<https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-order-by/> that provides SQL explanation and also provided examples of SQL problem typically encountered on the job
* Free account from [this web]<https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding?question_type=2&company=&is_correct_solution=&is_bookmarked=&is_freemium=true&in_depth_solution=&difficulty=&python=&filters=&page=1&page_size=25> provides interview style exercies for SQL





Meanwhile, the pwoer of BI software can easily help to visualise data without knowing programming.
